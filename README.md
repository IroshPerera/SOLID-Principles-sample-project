# SOLID Principles in Java

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of the SOLID principles in Java. Each principle is illustrated with both "good" and "bad" examples, showcasing the correct and incorrect ways to apply these principles in software design.

### What are SOLID Principles?

SOLID is an acronym representing five design principles that help developers build more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software systems:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details, but details should depend on abstractions.
